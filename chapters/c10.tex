\chapter{Homecoming}
Time slipped like sand through his fingers as Shiva entered ninth standard. This was the age when the school van was left behind, when the small magic of being driven gave way to something earned—a bicycle of his own. He got a geared cycle, its brakes betraying him on the very first day.

The thirty-minute ride from school to home felt like a declaration of independence, even as the Indian summer’s loo lashed against his face. Pedaling along the same road, beside the vast, open riverbed, he overtook the familiar school van. Watching it move past him—slow, enclosed, unchanged—he felt something settle inside him. He was no longer a boy being carried home. He was moving forward on his own.

Shreya's call had become his daily task after reaching home. Sharing the day's proceedings, were felt like a necessity to be told. Only occasionally, something confronting appeared between them.
